# Customer Tracker (Covid-19)

## Introduction

â€¢	This is an Internet Of Things project. This project is based on real time situation that is Covid-19. 
Now a day it is compulsory to keep a security person at the entrance of public area such as; grocery store, Language proficiency test centers, Ontario service center and so on to maintain total person's strength inside the public premises which helps to keep a safe distance (2 Meter) between two persons.

## Project features

 2. LCD display to show messages on the screen.
 3. Red and Geeen lights to indicate alert.

## Programming Language used

## How codes work

 - There are two motion sensors kept at the entrance and exit door which
   tracks how many  person entered  and left. As the counter reach to the pre-defined capacity of store (e.g 50) it display a message on the LCD "Do not enter" along with Red Led at entrance door and as anyone left and number reduce to below 50 it display a message on the LED "You can enter now" along with Green Led.

## Advantages
